## Getting Started

Let's begin our exploration of the app by starting with user authentication. We'll review various screenshots of the screens, and I'll provide the technical details related to each screen below it.

### Authentication


| Login              | Register | Create Profile | Create Profile - 2
| :---------------- | :------------------: |:------------------: | -------------------: |
| <img src="./assets/Screens/Login.jpg" width="200" height="400" />     |   <img src="./assets/Screens/Register.jpg" width="200" height="400" />    | <img src="./assets/Screens/Create-Profile.jpg" width="200" height="400" />  |<img src="./assets/Screens/Create-Profile-2.jpg" width="200" height="400" />  |


### Home Screen

| Home Screen 1 | Home Screen 2 |
| :---------------- | :------------------: |
| <img src="./assets/Screens/Home-Screen-1.jpg" width="300" height="600" />     |   <img src="./assets/Screens/Home-Screen-2.jpg" width="300" height="600" />    |

* The Home Screen contains 3 sections
   * The first section displays recently completed tasks along with their progress percentages in a progress bar.
   * The second section lists habits sorted by time. For instance, if you've added a habit for 9 AM, the app will prioritize showing upcoming habits followed by others.
   * The third section features tasks scheduled for the day, arranged by their designated times, as explained earlier.
     
 
### User Profile

| User Profile | Edit Profile |
| :---------------- | :------------------: |
| <img src="./assets/Screens/User-Profile.jpg" width="300" height="600" />     |   <img src="./assets/Screens/Edit-Profile-1.jpg" width="300" height="600" />    |


### Create & Edit Tasks

| Create Task 1 | Create Task 2 | Edit Task
| :---------------- | :------------------: | -------------------: |
| <img src="./assets/Screens/Create-Task-1.jpg" width="200" height="400" />     |  <img src="./assets/Screens/Create-Task-2.jpg" width="200" height="400" />     |  <img src="./assets/Screens/Edit-Task.jpg" width="200" height="400" />    |


### Task Home Page

| Task Home - 1 | Task Home - 2 | Task Home - 3 | Task Home - 4 |
| :---------------- | :------------------: | :------------------: | -------------------: |
| <img src="./assets/Screens/Tasks-Home-1.jpg" width="200" height="400" />     |  <img src="./assets/Screens/Tasks-Home-2.jpg" width="200" height="400" />     |  <img src="./assets/Screens/Tasks-Home-3.jpg"  width="200" height="400" />    |  <img src="./assets/Screens/Tasks-Home-4.jpg"  width="200" height="400" />    |

* Tasks on the tasks homepage can be sorted based on date, category, and task status.
* When sorting by date, tasks related to today are prioritized, and the default sorting is based on the date.
* Categories are sorted alphabetically.
* When sorting based on task status, working and pending tasks are listed first, followed by expired and completed tasks.

### Main Tasks
| Main Task 1 | Main Task 2 |
| :---------------- | :------------------: |
| <img src="./assets/Screens/Main-Task-1.jpg" width="300" height="600" />     |   <img src="./assets/Screens/Main-Task-2.jpg" width="300" height="600" />    |

* The tasks are referred to as "main tasks," and these main tasks can be further divided into sub-tasks.
* For example, if "Learning JavaScript" is your task, you can break it down into sub-tasks, which may include different concepts like Arrays & Objects, Closures, etc.
* Subtasks can have different start and end times within the main task's start and end times.
* Each Main Task should contain at least one sub-task.
* The progress of the main task is evaluated based on the completion of its sub-tasks.
* Based on the analysis of the task's start and end times and its progress, you will be rewarded with "Fire Tokens."
* A Fire Token is an in-app currency that can be used to unlock premium features in the app.

### Sub Tasks

| Sub Task - 1 | Timer - 1 | Sub Task - 2 |
| :---------------- | :------------------: | -------------------: |
| <img src="./assets/Screens/Sub-Task-1.jpg" width="200" height="400" />     |  <img src="./assets/Screens/Timer-1.jpg" width="200" height="400" />     |  <img src="./assets/Screens/Sub-Task-3.jpg"  width="200" height="400" />    |
