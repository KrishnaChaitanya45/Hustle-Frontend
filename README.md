## Getting Started

Let's begin our exploration of the app by starting with user authentication. We'll review various screenshots of the screens, and I'll provide the technical details related to each screen below it.

### Authentication

### Home Screen

* The Home Screen contains 3 sections
   * The first section displays recently completed tasks along with their progress percentages in a progress bar.
   * The second section lists habits sorted by time. For instance, if you've added a habit for 9 AM, the app will prioritize showing upcoming habits followed by others.
   * The third section features tasks scheduled for the day, arranged by their designated times, as explained earlier.
